            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Generation Alpha includes anyone born from 2013 to approximately 2025. This makes Gen Alpha currently between 
              0 and 12 years old in 2025. Gen Alpha is the first generation born entirely in the 21st century and the first 
              to grow up with AI, voice assistants, and tablets as normal parts of childhood from birth.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Key Characteristics of Gen Alpha</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-600 mt-8 mb-3">Born with Technology</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Gen Alpha never knew a world without touchscreens, voice commands, or streaming content. Many learned to 
              swipe on tablets before they could walk. They interact with AI assistants like Alexa and Siri as naturally 
              as talking to family members. For Gen Alpha, asking a device a question or watching videos on demand is 
              not technology but simply how the world works.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-600 mt-8 mb-3">Shaped by the Pandemic</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Many Gen Alpha children experienced remote schooling during COVID-19 at crucial developmental ages. They 
              adapted to virtual classrooms, online socialization, and hybrid learning models. This early experience with 
              digital education will shape how they view learning and work throughout their lives.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-600 mt-8 mb-3">Most Diverse Generation</h3>

              that reflect a wide range of structures, cultures, and backgrounds. This generation will likely have more 
              progressive attitudes toward diversity, inclusion, and social issues than any generation before them.

              They use AI for homework help, entertainment recommendations, and creative projects. Tools like ChatGPT, 
              AI image generators, and smart assistants are as normal to them as calculators were to previous generations.
