            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Baby Boomers include anyone born between 1946 and 1964. This makes Baby Boomers currently between 
              61 and 79 years old in 2025. The name comes from the dramatic increase in birth rates following World War II, 
              when returning soldiers started families during a period of unprecedented economic prosperity.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Key Characteristics of Baby Boomers</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-600 mt-8 mb-3">Strong Work Ethic</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Baby Boomers are known for their dedication to work and belief in paying your dues. They value face time 
              at the office, climbing the corporate ladder, and loyalty to employers. Many Boomers worked for the same 
              company for decades, something unheard of in younger generations. They believe hard work and dedication 
              lead to success and financial security.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-600 mt-8 mb-3">Optimistic and Idealistic</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Growing up during post-war prosperity, Boomers developed an optimistic worldview. They believed they could 
              change the world and drove major social movements in the 1960s and 70s including civil rights, feminism, 
              and environmentalism. This generation coined phrases like peace and love and questioned authority while 
              pursuing idealistic goals.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-600 mt-8 mb-3">Competitive and Success-Driven</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              As the largest generation in history, Boomers competed for everything: jobs, college spots, housing, and 
              promotions. This created a highly competitive, achievement-oriented mindset. They measure success through 
              career titles, home ownership, and material possessions. The phrase keeping up with the Joneses originated 
              from Boomer culture.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-600 mt-8 mb-3">Prefer Traditional Communication</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Baby Boomers prefer phone calls and face-to-face meetings over texting or email. They value personal 
              relationships built through direct interaction. While many have adapted to technology, they did not grow 
              up with it and often prefer traditional methods of communication and doing business.
