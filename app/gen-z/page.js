            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Generation Z includes anyone born between 1997 and 2012. This makes Gen Z currently between 
              13 and 28 years old in 2025. Gen Z is the first generation to grow up entirely with smartphones, social media, 
              and instant internet access from childhood. They have never known a world without Google, YouTube, or mobile apps.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Key Characteristics of Gen Z</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-3">Digital Natives</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Unlike Millennials who adapted to technology, Gen Z was born into it. They learned to swipe before they could 
              write, grew up with tablets as toys, and consider technology an extension of themselves rather than a tool. 
              This generation is incredibly tech-savvy, able to navigate multiple platforms simultaneously and learn new 
              apps intuitively.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-3">Socially Conscious</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Gen Z is known for their strong stance on social justice, climate change, LGBTQ+ rights, and racial equality. 
              They expect brands and employers to take clear positions on social issues and will actively boycott companies 
              that do not align with their values. Mental health awareness and destigmatization is particularly important to 
              this generation.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-3">Entrepreneurial Spirit</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Having witnessed Millennials struggle with student debt and economic uncertainty, Gen Z is highly entrepreneurial. 
              They are more likely to have side hustles, create content online, or pursue freelance work. Many aspire to be 
              influencers, content creators, or start their own businesses rather than follow traditional career paths.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mt-8 mb-3">Short Attention Spans, High Efficiency</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Gen Z has an average attention span of 8 seconds compared to 12 for Millennials, but this is not necessarily 
              negative. They have developed incredible ability to filter information quickly, multitask across platforms, and 
              find answers fast. They prefer bite-sized content like TikToks, Instagram Reels, and short-form videos.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Gen Z in the Workplace</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Gen Z values flexibility, work-life balance, and purpose-driven work even more than Millennials. They expect 
              remote work options, mental health support, and clear career progression. This generation is less likely to 
              stay in jobs that do not align with their values or offer growth opportunities. They communicate directly, 
              appreciate feedback, and want to feel their work makes a difference.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Cultural Markers That Define Gen Z</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
              <li>COVID-19 Pandemic: Experienced crucial high school and college years remotely</li>
              <li>TikTok: The defining social platform of their generation</li>
              <li>Climate Activism: Greta Thunberg and youth-led environmental movements</li>
              <li>Streaming Everything: Never knew cable TV, grew up with Netflix, Spotify, YouTube</li>
              <li>Me Too Movement: Witnessed major cultural reckoning during formative years</li>
              <li>Political Polarization: Came of age during highly divided political climate</li>
              <li>Meme Culture: Communication heavily influenced by internet humor and viral trends</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Gen Z Communication Style</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Gen Z prefers texting over calling, values authenticity over polish, and uses humor especially self-deprecating 
              constantly. They communicate through memes, GIFs, and emojis as a language of their own. Unlike Millennials who 
              often overshare, Gen Z is more private about personal information online but highly expressive about their 
              identities and values.
