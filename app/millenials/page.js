            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Millennials, also known as Generation Y, include anyone born between 1981 and 1996. This makes 
              Millennials currently between 29 and 44 years old in 2025. Millennials came of age during the rise of the internet, 
              witnessed 9/11 as young adults, and entered the workforce during or after the 2008 financial crisis.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Key Characteristics of Millennials</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-8 mb-3">Digital Pioneers</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Millennials are the bridge generation between analog and digital. They remember life before cell phones and 
              social media but adapted quickly to new technology. They grew up with dial-up internet, instant messaging like AIM and MSN, 
              and witnessed the birth of Facebook, YouTube, and smartphones. This makes them uniquely skilled at both traditional 
              and digital communication.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-8 mb-3">Value Experiences Over Things</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Millennials pioneered the shift from material possessions to experiences. They prioritize travel, dining out, 
              concerts, and activities over buying homes or expensive items. This generation coined the term YOLO and 
              popularized sharing experiences on social media. Economic factors also play a role since many Millennials face 
              student debt and high housing costs that make traditional milestones harder to achieve.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-8 mb-3">Work-Life Balance Advocates</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Unlike Baby Boomers who lived to work, Millennials work to live. They value flexible schedules, remote work 
              options, and companies that respect personal time. This generation questions the traditional 9-5 model and expects 
              their work to have purpose and meaning. They are known for job-hopping more than previous generations, seeking 
              better opportunities and work environments.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mt-8 mb-3">Socially Conscious Consumers</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Millennials care about brand values, sustainability, and social responsibility. They research companies before 
              buying, support small businesses, and prefer brands that align with their ethics. This generation drives the 
              demand for organic food, sustainable products, and companies that take stands on social issues.
            </p>
