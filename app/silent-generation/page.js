            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The Silent Generation includes anyone born between 1928 and 1945. This makes the Silent Generation currently 
              between 80 and 97 years old in 2025. They are called silent because they were raised to respect authority, 
              work hard without complaint, and avoid making waves. This generation grew up during the Great Depression and 
              World War II, shaping their values of sacrifice, duty, and perseverance.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Key Characteristics of the Silent Generation</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-600 mt-8 mb-3">Hardworking and Resilient</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Having grown up during the Great Depression, the Silent Generation learned the value of hard work and 
              frugality early. Many experienced genuine poverty and rationing during World War II. This taught them to 
              waste nothing, save everything, and work tirelessly to provide security for their families. They believe 
              in earning what you have and are uncomfortable with debt.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-600 mt-8 mb-3">Respect for Authority</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The Silent Generation was raised to respect elders, follow rules, and trust institutions. They value 
              hierarchy, proper etiquette, and doing things by the book. This generation rarely questioned authority 
              figures like teachers, doctors, or government officials. They believe in working within the system rather 
              than challenging it.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-600 mt-8 mb-3">Financially Conservative</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Having witnessed economic collapse during the Depression, the Silent Generation is extremely financially 
              cautious. They save aggressively, avoid unnecessary risks, and prefer tangible assets like homes and savings 
              accounts. Credit cards and loans make them uncomfortable. Many kept cash hidden at home as insurance against 
              another economic disaster.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-600 mt-8 mb-3">Traditional Values</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The Silent Generation holds traditional views on family, work, and society. They believe in clear gender 
              roles, formal manners, and community standards. Marriage was expected and typically lifelong. Church attendance 
              was common, and reputation in the community mattered greatly. They value stability, tradition, and maintaining 
              social order.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Why Called the Silent Generation?</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The term Silent Generation was coined in a 1951 Time magazine article describing them as grave, cautious, 
              and unimaginative. Sandwiched between the Greatest Generation who fought WWII and the vocal Baby Boomers, 
              they were seen as conformist and risk-averse. However, this characterization overlooks their significant 
              contributions to civil rights, arts, and business leadership.

              in the workplace, and now use smartphones and the internet. While many embraced technology for practical
