            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Generation X includes anyone born between <strong>1965 and 1980</strong>. This makes Gen X currently between 
              45 and 60 years old in 2025. Often called the forgotten generation or middle child between Baby Boomers and 
              Millennials, Gen X quietly shaped modern culture while flying under the radar.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Key Characteristics of Gen X</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-600 mt-8 mb-3">The Latchkey Kids</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Gen X earned the nickname latchkey kids because many came home to empty houses as both parents worked. They 
              learned independence and self-reliance early. This generation is comfortable being alone, solving problems 
              themselves, and doesn't need constant validation or supervision. This independence shaped their skeptical, 
              self-sufficient nature.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-600 mt-8 mb-3">Adaptable and Resourceful</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Gen X grew up with rotary phones and learned to code on Commodore 64s. They adapted to personal computers, 
              email, mobile phones, and smartphones as adults. This makes them uniquely skilled at both analog and digital 
              worlds. They can fix things themselves, figure things out without YouTube tutorials, and aren't intimidated 
              by technology.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-600 mt-8 mb-3">Work-Life Balance Pioneers</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Gen X watched their Boomer parents sacrifice everything for work and said no thanks. They prioritized family 
              time and personal life more than previous generations. Gen X introduced the concept that work doesn't have to 
              consume your identity. They work hard but leave at 5pm without guilt.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-600 mt-8 mb-3">Skeptical and Cynical</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Gen X grew up during Watergate, economic recessions, rising divorce rates, and the AIDS crisis. This bred 
              healthy skepticism toward authority, institutions, and corporate promises. They question everything, don't 
              trust easily, and value authenticity over polish. This generation invented alternative culture and grunge 
              precisely because they rejected mainstream phoniness.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Gen X in the Workplace</h2>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mt-4">
              <li><strong>Direct communicators:</strong> No corporate speak, just tell it like it is</li>
              <li><strong>Results-focused:</strong> Care about output, not face time in the office</li>
              <li><strong>Hands-off managers:</strong> Trust employees to do their jobs without micromanaging</li>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Why Gen X is Called the Forgotten Generation</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Gen X is smaller than both Baby Boomers and Millennials, making them less influential in marketing and media. 
              They're sandwiched between two loud, large generations and content to stay under the radar. Gen X doesn't 
              complain much, solves problems quietly, and doesn't seek attention. While Boomers and Millennials dominate 
              headlines, Gen X runs things behind the scenes and prefers it that way.
